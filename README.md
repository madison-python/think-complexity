# A quick tour of Allen Downey's Think Complexity

For our next meeting I will be giving a quick tour of one of Allen Downey's free and open source books on python programming called _Think Complexity_. In the book, he explores various flavors of "complexity science" such as the dynamics of small world networks, cellular automatons, and implementing Conway's Game of Life. It's a fun book because he boils down complicated concepts into simple bits of code, and I think there will be a lot of good material in here for people new to python. You can get your own copy of the book for free here: http://greenteapress.com/wp/think-complexity-2e/

Allen Downey is a computer scientist and author of many books on python and what you can do with python such as _Think Python_, _Think Stats_, _Think Bayes_, and _Think DSP_. You can get links to all of his books here: http://greenteapress.com/wp/

If you have read _Think Complexity_ or are familiar with complexity science, get in touch with me via email or on Slack.

## Setting up
